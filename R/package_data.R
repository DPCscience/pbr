#' Genotypic data on a two-row barley population
#'
#' @description
#' A \code{data.frame} of genomewide marker data. 1598 barley individuals were genotyped
#' with 2187 DNA markers. The data has been curated and filtered to remove markers
#' and individuals with a high amount of missing data.
#'
#' @format An object of class \code{data.frame} with 2187 rows and 1602 columns. The first 4
#' columns contain the marker names, the allele states, the chromosome, and the position
#' on each chromosome. The remaining columns contain the genotype states for each barley line.

#' @description
#' A \code{data.frame} of phenotypic data. 1590 barley individuals were phenotyped in 6 trials
#' for grain yield and plant height.

#' @description
#' A \code{data.frame} of phenotypic data. 246 barley individuals were each phenotyped in 3 trials
#' for grain yield and plant height.
